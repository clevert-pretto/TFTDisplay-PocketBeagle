# TFTDisplay-PocketBeagle
TFT Display Q070LRE-L81, PocketBeagle (HDMI Implementation)

I was just wondering If I can interface [Innolux Q070LRE-L81|https://www.twscreen.com/en/lcdpanel/7121/cmo/q070lre-l81/7/1024x600-Tablet-Computer-LCD-Panel] with Pocket Beagle.

# Challenges I Have:
- No Datasheet for Innolux Q070LRE-L81.
- Pocket Beagle do not support HDMI interface,(But Beaglebone black do have MiceoHDMI and it has same microcontroller as Pocket Beagle).
- Might be I need intermediate converters, drivers to and fro between display and camera.

Then, I also want to interface camera with it. Camera is from my old Asus Zen phone. (It datasheet also not available).

Anyone can contribute to thisproject, Every deveoper who is interested to work on real Development can come and join me.
